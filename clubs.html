<p><b>About</b></p>
<p>In 2019, the Department of CSE established the ROBOTIC LAB as part of an MOU with SmartBridge. Our mission is to develop students’ interest in the world of robotics and to materialise their dream of building fascinating yet useful robots through consistent set robot building and more challenging competitions that provide an innovative singularity to their dreams. Our primary goal is to explore, develop, and innovate. It was entirely fueled by the students’ enthusiasm and interest.</p>
